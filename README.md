## VBGUI \- A library to help iron out some of the annoyances of GUI programming


</div>

### Description

This code helps to remove some of the more annoying things about designing a GUI in VB. All of the classes here do so by subclassing controls.

The classes included are as follows:

- CAnchor: Mimics the behaviour of anchored controls in .NET, so that you aren't forever adding code to the Resize event of a form.

- CMinMaxSize: Allows you to set the minimum and maximum sizes for a form.

- CMouseEvents: Gives you access to the mouse events in Windows that VB does not expose - i.e. hover and leave events, and mouse wheel events.

- CRTBLinks: Makes light work of automatic URL detection in the RichTextBox.

- CScrollbar: Gives you access to the 'proper' API scrollbars as opposed to VB's ones.

The project group includes a test project for you to see it all in action.

NOTE: You may have to make the whole project group before it is usable as the test project depends on the library.
